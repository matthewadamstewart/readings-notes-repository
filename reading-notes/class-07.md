### [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)
* Explains structure of URL
* http is a protocol which describes location on the global web, for pages and a lot else
* explains resources and URLs
* Explains Webservices and API
* Uses those protocols without a person sitting there, allowing machines to talk to each other without a person
* explains noun, adjative and verb important

* Important explains verbs affect nouns in a syntaxually significant way that makes sense in english


* **Example:**
> ME: Well.. Take a look at your coffee table. What are the nouns? Laptop, bottle, book, paper. Now, what are some things you can do to all of these things?

> Brother: I don't understand what you mean...

> ME: You can "get" them, right? You can pick them up. You can knock them on the floor. You can burn them. You can apply those same exact verbs to any of the objects sitting there.

> Brother: Okay... so?

> ME: Well, that's important. What if instead of me being able to say to you, "get the bottle," and "get the magazine," and "get the book"; what if instead we needed to come up with different verbs for each of the nouns? I couldn't use the word "get" universally, but instead had to think up a new word for each verb/noun combination. "shmet the bottle", "mandle the magazine", "zorp the book"


* "GET is a pretty important verb", indeed it is
