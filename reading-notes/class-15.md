### Reading
**Consider the history:** [Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/)

* Cites current gender statistics of the major tech companies
* Cites statistics in the 1970's and 1980's
* Makes point about wage opportunities afforded by a career in programing and computer science
* Draws conclusions that opportunities must be limited to female
* Discusses video game marketing using targeting male demographics in an attempt to maximize profit as the cause of this issue rather than an effect of presumed preferences
* Does not analyse whether marketing to girls would have have been financially optimal or even viable
* Does discuss the 'Matthew effect' (_For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them._) without realizing they are talking about a doumented phenomenon from _Outliers_ by Malcolm-Gladwell when they talk about the positive feedback loop of male gamers becoming interected in computers which results in more computer games made with to be gratifying to the tastes of the creator's demographic, ie people tend to make things they themselves like
* This does produce a gap in experience betweens genders, one could even say growing environmental forces to producing distinct memetically defined sexually-dimorphic skill specialization, increasing the significant and meaningful differences between male and female at the cost of losing access to female perspective in the tech industry
* Diversity is valuable, so people be _genuinely_ different is valuable.
* The article seems to take the view that women _should_ want to be in the tech industry without saying why they should want that other than the career and fincial rewards without taking into account real and meaningful emotional, social and less statistically quantifiable things which may motivate individuals.
* The article also seems to completely miss the point of marketing, which is to maximize profits as it isn't public service announcements but money invevested for the sake of fairly immediate financial return to those whom may be likely persuaded to buy something


**Review the data:** [Employee breakdown of key technology companies](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)

* I am surprise that some minority are represented at a higher percentage than their national demographics in a few companies
* Like four companies had more than 6 times the national percentage of a particular minority
* The way I understand the common usage of 'equality' now days is that the goal would be parity between both national ethnic and gender demographics and that of a company make-up.
* This makes me wonder what forces are at work in company selection and individuals applying self-selection
 

**Ask the question:** [Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

* Diverse teams are smarter and more creative
* Diverse companies perform better
* Companies are losing out on great talent 
* Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base
* It’s the right thing to do
